'''
Proof-of-concept Dshell plugin to detect INNUENDO DNS Channel

Based on the short marketing video (http://vimeo.com/115206626) the
INNUENDO DNS Channel relies on DNS to communicate with an authoritative
name server. The name server will respond with a base64 encoded TXT
answer. This plugin will analyze DNS TXT queries and responses to
determine if it matches the network traffic described in the video.
There are multiple assumptions (*very poor*) in this detection plugin
but serves as a proof-of-concept detector. This detector has not been
tested against authentic INNUENDO DNS Channel traffic.
