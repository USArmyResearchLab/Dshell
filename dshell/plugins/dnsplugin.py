'''
This is a base-level plugin intended to handle DNS lookups and responses

It inherits from the base ConnectionPlugin and provides a new handler
function: dns_handler(conn, requests, responses)

It automatically pairs request/response packets by ID and passes them to the
handler for a custom plugin, such as dns.py, to use.

    DIRTY HACK ALERT

    This function exists to convert DNS CNAME responses into human-readable
    strings. pypacker cannot currently convert these, so this one attempts
    to do it. However, it is not complete and will only work for the most
    common situations (i.e. no pointers, or pointers that only point to the
    first request).

    Feed it the bytes (query.name) of the first request and the bytes for the
    answer (answer.address) with a CNAME, and it will return the parsed string.
